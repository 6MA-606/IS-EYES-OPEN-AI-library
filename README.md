# IS EYES OPEN??? project

This project is a simple project that uses a pre-trained model to detect if the eyes are open or closed.

Created by: [6MA-606 (Me)](https://github.com/6MA-606) and The appriopriate credits to Chat-GPT4o that helped me a lot in this project.

> Note: This project is meme project for fun and not for serious use.
> My purpose is to test how fast I can make some AI project with AI (Chat-GPT4o). So, don't take it seriously. I don't have any knowledge about AI and I'm not a professional in this field.
